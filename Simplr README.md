wip to render local files in a 2D- 3D space, zooming map interface, contextual auto/ML organization of files. A spatial file explorer.
Please check out https://alexandermc.xyz/simplr/ for an overview of this project.

After sitting on this idea for 9 years, I think I would like to see how fesiable this kind of interface could be. Hardware today should be able to dynamically display the most relevant 1000 files at a time to the user. Not to get ahead of my self either, but combined with AR and VR workspaces, this idea should have some legs.

Totally new to Git but believe this is the place to start
